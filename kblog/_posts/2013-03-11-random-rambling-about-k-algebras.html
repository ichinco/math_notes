<p>In trying to verify II.3.7 in [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1362978290&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=Hartshorne">H</a>], we came upon a discussion which I would like to summarize here:</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Let <span class="render-math">k</span> be a field, then any <span class="render-math">k</span>-algebra <span class="render-math">R</span> with finitely many prime ideals has dimension 0. In general, a ring <span class="render-math">R</span> with finitely many prime ideals is not necessarily Artin. The case here follows from the following facts.</p>
<p>1) Noether normalization: any <span class="render-math">k</span>-algebra <span class="render-math">R</span> is finite (as a module) over <span class="render-math">k[x_1,\dots,x_n]</span> for some <span class="render-math">n</span>. In the case where <span class="render-math">k</span> is infinite see [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Commutative-Algebra-Michael-Atiyah/dp/0201407515/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1362980096&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=atiyah+macdonald+commutative+algebra">AM</a>, Ex 5.16], and the general case, see [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Commutative-Algebra-Algebraic-Geometry-Mathematics/dp/0387942696/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1362980096&#038;sr=1-2&#038;keywords=atiyah+macdonald+commutative+algebra">E</a>, Sect. 8.2.1].</p>
<p>2) <span class="render-math">k[x]</span> (a PID and thus a UFD) necessarily has infinitely many prime ideals, since it has infinitely many irreducible polynomials, each of which generates a prime. (The Euclid&#8217;s argument used to prove this is due to EK: if there were only finitely many irreducible polynomials <span class="render-math">f_1,\dots,f_k</span>, consider <span class="render-math">1 + \prod_k f_k</span>, which is either irreducible or contains an irreducible factor not one of <span class="render-math">f_1,\dots,f_k</span>.)</p>
<p>It follows from (1) and (2) that if <span class="render-math">R</span> is finite over <span class="render-math">k[x_1,\dots,x_n]</span>, and if <span class="render-math">R</span> has only finitely many primes, then <span class="render-math">n = 0</span> and <span class="render-math">R</span> is finite over <span class="render-math">k</span>. That is, <span class="render-math">R</span> is a finite dimensional vector space.</p>
<p>In this way, for any domain <span class="render-math">B</span>, and <span class="render-math">A</span> finitely generated <span class="render-math">B</span>-domain. If <span class="render-math">A \otimes_B K(B)</span> is a <span class="render-math">K(B)</span>-algebra with finitely many primes, by Noether normalization, <span class="render-math">A \otimes_B K(B)</span> is finite over <span class="render-math">K(B)[x_1,\cdots,x_n]</span>; by the above, it must be integral over <span class="render-math">K(B)</span>. That is, <span class="render-math">A \otimes_B K(B)</span> is a field equal to <span class="render-math">K(A)</span>.</p>
<p>In preparation for what is to come, we prove that for <span class="render-math">A</span> and <span class="render-math">B</span> as above, there exists some multiplicative set <span class="render-math">S \subset B</span> such that <span class="render-math">A \otimes_B S^{-1}B</span> is a finite <span class="render-math">S^{-1}B</span> module. </p>
<p>To see this, notice that <span class="render-math">A</span> is a finitely generated <span class="render-math">B</span>-algebra. Write <span class="render-math">A = B[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I</span> for some ideal <span class="render-math">I</span> in the polynomial ring with coefficients in <span class="render-math">B</span>. Certainly, each <span class="render-math">x_i</span> is an element of <span class="render-math">K(A)</span> and satisfies some monic polynomial with coefficient in <span class="render-math">K(B)</span>:<br />
\\[<br />
x_i^{m_i} + \\sum_{j = 0}^N_i \\frac{b_{i,j}}{f_{i,j}}x_i^j = 0.<br />
\\]<br />
Let <span class="render-math">S</span> be the multiplicative subset of <span class="render-math">B</span> generated by <span class="render-math">f_{i,j}</span>. It is plain that each <span class="render-math">x_i</span> is integral over <span class="render-math">S^{-1}B</span>, and <span class="render-math">A \otimes_B S^{-1}B</span> is finitely over <span class="render-math">S^{-1}B</span> as a module by generators <span class="render-math">x_1^{m_i} \cdots x_n^{m_n}</span> where <span class="render-math">m_1 + \cdots + m_n < N_1 + \cdots + N_n</span> (and hence of finite quantity).</p>

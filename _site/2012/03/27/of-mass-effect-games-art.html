  <h1 class="post-title">Of Mass Effect, Games, and Art</h1>
  <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2012</span>
  <p>The recent outrage over Mass Effect 3&#8242;s ending has sparked quite a &#8220;debate&#8221;. Really, it&#8217;s not a debate, more like fans talking in a cordoned section of the internet while the others &#8212; game critics, journalists, game industry giants, and non-Mass Effect gamers &#8212; take turn criticizing how Bioware has caved to public demands while compromising the artistic integrity of the gaming building process. In this regard, CH was right to call the ending &#8220;polarizing&#8221;; it sparked not a discussion about the ending, but the nature of the industry.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I struggle with the question myself: should Bioware have altered the outcome of ME3? On the one hand, the ending was not satisfactory. The lack of closure, blatant plot holes, and the dizzying nonsensical, logic-defying, nihilistic ending that many ME fans have labored over 100hrs for merited the outrage. In fact, as a loose ME fan, I was immensely disappointed. An unspoken (or rather, softly spoken) possibility is that a dev schedule is put on Bioware, who bucked under the pressure, and released the best possible product under the circumstances.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an artist, in some sense should uphold the so-called &#8220;artistic integrity&#8221;, which refers to the principle that an artistic creation must not and should not be influenced by anyone other than the artists. If Bioware changed the ending to ME, in many ways, they have failed to adhere to their artistic vision, and have allowed the desire of profit or healthy public image take precedent over that very principle.</p>
<p>As I waver between the two thoughts, I am currently leaning towards the idea that a computer game such as ME should in fact be held to a different principle. </p>
<p>On many scales, video games are an artistic medium. They sometimes have crafted plots that, when done right, can be the instrument to convey immensely deep ideas. Rich with its own artistic techniques, video games have matured since its first inception as merely as a form of entertainment for killing time. Anyone who has followed ME series from the first game would agree that the series has been an emotionally poignant, highly immersive, thematically rich, and philosophically deep episodes that can easily rival any movie or television series. In fact, more than any of the existing story medium &#8212; through deeply involved player interaction &#8212; the world of ME is populated with an unforgettable cast that is difficult to part with. </p>
<p>I, for one, felt like I have formed a deep emotional bond with my squad mates; hell, even with some of the side characters such as Charr and Ereba, Shiala, the scientists at Zhu&#8217;s Hope. What the game creators have done seemed impossible to parallel: not in a novel, a movie, or a TV series; in fact, only in a games.</p>
<p>So, there is little doubt that ME&#8217;s creators are artists in every right. Perhaps it is because that the ME series is so beautifully done that we forget an important part of the modern game creation process: commercial  publication and distribution. This often complicates the genre, because publishers and distributers sometimes make important inputs (for better or worse) on the creative process. Though they don&#8217;t necessarily dictate the artistic direction explicitly, publishers may rush production, curtail development processes that force certain dev cycles to preclude a storyline, or redistribute technological resources that can indirectly influence how a story turn out. Whether or not the leaked letters from dev team are real, the truth is probably not far from what is being described.</p>
<p>How I interpreted the ending to ME3: it was a product of both artistic visions (that part no one can deny) and the commercial nature of games. Not only did the game feel rushed, but that there were numerous plot points that were difficult to brush aside in the final minutes of the game. It felt like such a different game in the final minutes that many have taken to conspiracy theories (which is an interesting psychological and sociological phenomenon in it of itself): much of the cast was out of character, the supposed sacrifices cheapened by an impossible cause of the conflicts, and the player are left watching the story unfold into a meaningless &#8220;tragedy&#8221; that one can see as an uplifting sacrifice, only to question if those outcomes actually warranted the costly struggles and difficult decisions that seemed to have pervaded throughout the final saga.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is what art is. There is a chance that we are seeing the Mark Rothko of story telling, a post-modern piece about the futility of hope, about the meaning of triumph even in a struggle that has no victory, about the fundamental disconnect &#8212; both on a logical level, and on an emotional level &#8212; between a world dominated by laws seeking for order and the organic world that we live in. You can give a lot of creative interpretations to that ending and render it with whatever artistic quality that is ascribed to realities of life (we must have a pretty grim view about the realities of life).</p>
<p>Yet, the ending still <i>feels</i> out of place. It <i>feels</i> as if the choices and the preparation don&#8217;t matter. It <i>feels</i> that if the ME world were real, then all those who have perished along the way to combat the threat have died in vain. Where do these feelings originate is not necessarily from a desire to see the so-called &#8220;unicorn, rainbow, and cake&#8221; ending where Shepard retires to a beach, playing with his blue children while shooting beer cans against a burning reaper ship. </p>
<p>There is a difference between a worth-while sacrifice, a meaningful or deep sense of loss, and one that is sheer nonsense. Captain John Miller(<i>Saving Private Ryan</i>), General Kuribayashi (<i>Letters from Iwo Jima</i>), and Frodo Baggins (<i>LotR</i>) have all paid the ultimate price, fighting for what they believe in. One might even argue that the death of the entire squad in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> is largely meaningless: after all, shouldn&#8217;t victory be measured in numbers? But it had a larger theme to speak of, and that question never felt forcibly thrusted upon the audience; in fact, the point was debated throughout the movie, driving the viewers to ask the same. In this sense, while the theme of sacrifice (however bleak) is present throughout these three stories, it never felt out of place. In fact, the stories are empowered by that theme. </p>
<p>The end of ME3, on the other hand, riddled with death, left us wondering &#8220;why?&#8221; Why must this be? There were many possibilities, many other endings that could have been more poignant that gave meaning and context to the struggle. For you see, one doesn&#8217;t even need to win the war (as in <i>Letters</i>), but that something more noble than a misguided attempt to correct a nonexistent problem, followed by a half-baked attempt to correct this seemed to be in order. To give your life to the fight so that you can survive, so that you can be free, so that you can make a statement about the nature of these misguided attempts to bring order to the universe. As you see, ME1 and 2, and for the majority of 3 made us believe in those very things; then, it seemed as if those more thematic aspects of the story were surrendered. The emotions of those who have been so invested were left grabbing for something to ground the loss of so many that they have cared about; when there is nothing there, what could have been sadness turned into anger.</p>
<p>This kind of outrage isn&#8217;t unprecedented. When Doyle supposedly killed Sherlock Holmes in &#8220;The Final Problem&#8221;, all of England rebelled (and that is not an exaggeration). And there, Holmes died a death befitting a hero! Under immense fan pressure, Doyle eventually resurrected Holmes, and the literary world benefitted.</p>
<p>Yet, this outrage stemmed from a graver charge than simply being displeased with how Shepard fared in the final hours of ME3. To put it simply, the fans are accusing that the ending was rushed for commercial reasons. If anything, the commercial forces that be have an obligation to deliver something satisfactory for that reason: a commercial obligation.</p>
<p>Still, artists who claim license over their work might want to ponder about this: the art world doesn&#8217;t consist of only artists who create works for themselves. Art is inherently a dialogue between artists and their respective audience. It has been more so now than ever before. While an artist should not always cater towards the taste and vision of the audience &#8212; those who do this in fact do compromise their integrity &#8212; it has always been an interplay between the two. It makes sense: art is <i>not</i> arbitrary. It doesn&#8217;t qualify itself as art simply because elsewhere in the piece something beautiful is made, at least not entirely. This notion of creating art for the sake of creating art doesn&#8217;t stand entirely, as there has always been an audience outside of the artist, and tautologically, there must always be someone else who instilled a piece of work with meaning for that piece to be art.</p>
<p>If that is the case, why can&#8217;t those who are most qualified to give significance to ME3 comment on, and even demand change from, the existing ending, especially since what is there resembled more a rough draft than the finished touch of an artist. It&#8217;s almost as if after painting the Mona Lisa&#8217;s face, Da Vinci simply finished the rest of the canvas with a weird shade of purple. When pressed by his audience, isn&#8217;t the onus on him to justify his artistic taste as to give others a chance to understand and substantiate? If none could be delivered, would it not have been better if he was given a chance to finish his work, especially since what he created was so vivid and breath-taking that it almost makes you cry?</p>
<p>I believe the best development of art is those that grew out of the conversation between the creator and the audience, for an important aspect of art is the refinement of ideas and of techniques to convey, expose, clarify, beautify, or pay homage to themes and ideas. Without audience, what differentiates art from the arbitrary rubbish of an idle mind?</p>
<p>And if art is about that dialogue, would it not have been better if it is not the artists&#8217; soliloquy?</p>

title: An IMO Problem Solved

<p>I recently encountered an IMO question that&#8217;s stated as follows: Given a function <span class="render-math">f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</span>  such that for any <span class="render-math">x, y \in \mathbb{R}</span>, <span class="render-math">f(x + y) \leq yf(x) + f(f(x))</span>, show that <span class="render-math">f(x) = 0</span>  for all <span class="render-math">x \leq 0</span>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are two solutions, and I will present the one that AM and I came up with: one can easily verify that <span class="render-math">f(x) \leq f(f(x))</span>. Let <span class="render-math">f^2(x) = f(f(x))</span>. We will proceed by showing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="render-math">f(x) \leq f^2(0)</span></li>
<li><span class="render-math">f(x) \leq 0</span></li>
<li><span class="render-math">f^2(0) = 0</span></li>
</ol>
<p>At which point the result should be fairly straight-forward.</p>
<p>To show (1), consider <span class="render-math">f(f(x)) = f(f(x) + 0) \leq f(x)f(0) + f^2(0)</span>. From this, we have that <span class="render-math">f(x - f(0)) \leq -f(0)f(x) + f^2(x) \leq -f(0)f(x) + f(0)f(x) + f^2(0) = f^2(0)</span>. As <span class="render-math">x</span>  is arbitrary, (1) follows.</p>
<p>For (2), let <span class="render-math">y > 0</span>, and consider <span class="render-math">f(x - y + y) \leq yf(x - y) + f^2(x + y)</span>. As <span class="render-math">y</span> is positive, we have that <span class="render-math">yf(x - y) \leq -y^2f(x) + yf(f(x))</span>, so <span class="render-math">f(x) \leq -y^2f(x) + yf^2(x) + f^2(x + y)</span>. Via (1), we have that <span class="render-math">f(f(x)) \leq f^2(0)</span>, <span class="render-math">f^2(x + y) \leq f^2(0)</span>, which in turn implies that <span class="render-math">f(x) \leq -y^2f(x) + (1 + y)f^2(0)</span>.</p>
<p>But this implies <span class="render-math">(1 + y^2)f(x) \leq (1 + y)f^2(0)</span>, which in turn implies that<br />
<span class="render-math"></span><br />
<div class="displaymath"><span class="render-math">f(x) \leq \frac{1 + y}{1 + y^2}f^2(0).</span></div>
<span class="render-math"></span><br />
As <span class="render-math">y</span> is arbitrary, we have that <span class="render-math">f(x) \leq 0</span>: this proves (2).</p>
<p>To prove (3), notice that for any <span class="render-math">x</span>, <span class="render-math">f(x) = f(x - 1 + 1) \leq f(x - 1) + f(f(x - 1))</span>, and use (1). That is <span class="render-math">2f^2(0) \geq f(x)</span> for any <span class="render-math">x</span> &#8212; in particular, <span class="render-math">x = f(0)</span>. Together with (2), we have <span class="render-math">f^2(0) = 0</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, as <span class="render-math">f^2(0) \leq f^3(0) = f(0)</span>, we have that <span class="render-math">f(0) = 0</span>; now observe <span class="render-math">0 = f(0) = f(x - x) \leq -xf(x) + f(f(x))</span>. The main result follows.</p>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In trying to verify II.3.7 in [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1362978290&amp;#038;sr=8-1&amp;#038;keywords=Hartshorne&quot;&gt;H&lt;/a&gt;], we came upon a discussion which I would like to summarize here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt; be a field, then any &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;-algebra &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; with finitely many prime ideals has dimension 0. In general, a ring &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; with finitely many prime ideals is not necessarily Artin. The case here follows from the following facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Noether normalization: any &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;-algebra &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; is finite (as a module) over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;k[x_1,\dots,x_n]&lt;/span&gt; for some &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;. In the case where &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt; is infinite see [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Commutative-Algebra-Michael-Atiyah/dp/0201407515/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1362980096&amp;#038;sr=1-1&amp;#038;keywords=atiyah+macdonald+commutative+algebra&quot;&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt;, Ex 5.16], and the general case, see [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Commutative-Algebra-Algebraic-Geometry-Mathematics/dp/0387942696/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1362980096&amp;#038;sr=1-2&amp;#038;keywords=atiyah+macdonald+commutative+algebra&quot;&gt;E&lt;/a&gt;, Sect. 8.2.1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;k[x]&lt;/span&gt; (a PID and thus a UFD) necessarily has infinitely many prime ideals, since it has infinitely many irreducible polynomials, each of which generates a prime. (The Euclid&amp;#8217;s argument used to prove this is due to EK: if there were only finitely many irreducible polynomials &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f_1,\dots,f_k&lt;/span&gt;, consider &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;1 + \prod_k f_k&lt;/span&gt;, which is either irreducible or contains an irreducible factor not one of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f_1,\dots,f_k&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows from (1) and (2) that if &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; is finite over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;k[x_1,\dots,x_n]&lt;/span&gt;, and if &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; has only finitely many primes, then &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;n = 0&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; is finite over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;. That is, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; is a finite dimensional vector space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, for any domain &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; finitely generated &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;-domain. If &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A \otimes_B K(B)&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;K(B)&lt;/span&gt;-algebra with finitely many primes, by Noether normalization, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A \otimes_B K(B)&lt;/span&gt; is finite over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;K(B)[x_1,\cdots,x_n]&lt;/span&gt;; by the above, it must be integral over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;K(B)&lt;/span&gt;. That is, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A \otimes_B K(B)&lt;/span&gt; is a field equal to &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;K(A)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for what is to come, we prove that for &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; as above, there exists some multiplicative set &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S \subset B&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A \otimes_B S^{-1}B&lt;/span&gt; is a finite &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S^{-1}B&lt;/span&gt; module. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see this, notice that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; is a finitely generated &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;-algebra. Write &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A = B[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I&lt;/span&gt; for some ideal &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; in the polynomial ring with coefficients in &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;. Certainly, each &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x_i&lt;/span&gt; is an element of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;K(A)&lt;/span&gt; and satisfies some monic polynomial with coefficient in &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;K(B)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
\\[&lt;br /&gt;
x_i^{m_i} + \\sum_{j = 0}^N_i \\frac{b_{i,j}}{f_{i,j}}x_i^j = 0.&lt;br /&gt;
\\]&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; be the multiplicative subset of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; generated by &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f_{i,j}&lt;/span&gt;. It is plain that each &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x_i&lt;/span&gt; is integral over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S^{-1}B&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A \otimes_B S^{-1}B&lt;/span&gt; is finitely over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S^{-1}B&lt;/span&gt; as a module by generators &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x_1^{m_i} \cdots x_n^{m_n}&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;m_1 + \cdots + m_n &lt; N_1 + \cdots + N_n&lt;/span&gt; (and hence of finite quantity).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Chern Classes - Part 1 of Several</title>
   <link href="http://blog.knightfu.com/2012/04/14/chern-classes-part-1.html"/>
   <updated>2012-04-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.knightfu.com/2012/04/14/chern-classes-part-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_class&quot;&gt;Chern classes&lt;/a&gt; are a collection of invariants in differential and algebraic geometry. In the analytic setting, Chern classes are characteristic invariant of vector bundles on complex smooth manifolds; in algebraic geometry, Chern classes are invariants of locally free coherent sheaves over projective schemes. For the latter, if such schemes are &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/span&gt;-schemes, in which case such coherent sheaves are the algebraic analogues of vector bundles, via duality theories in the respective domains, the two Chern classes agree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general when it comes to manifolds, there are a lot of parallels between analytic and algebraic techniques. Whether or not it is the aim of these two camps to cooperate, certainly understanding how to transition from one to another greatly increases the level of understanding regarding manifold theory. In view of this, I aim to answer the following: what is an intuitive way to understand why the two approaches to Chern classes are the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exposition is broken roughly into the following sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Chern classes of locally free coherent sheaves over projective schemes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Chern classes of complex vector bundles over smooth manifolds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Intersection theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dictionary: bridging the gap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sections will not correspond to entries: I intend to split this exposition into manageable chunks to write. The references will be composed of bits and pieces from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Differential-Algebraic-Topology-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/1441928154/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334433669&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[BoTu]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Intersection-Theory-Edition-William-Fulton/dp/0387985492/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334365406&amp;#038;sr=8-1-spell&quot;&gt;[F]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Algebraic-Geometry-Phillip-Griffiths/dp/0471050598/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334365468&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[GrHa]&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Hodge-Theory-Complex-Algebraic-Geometry/dp/0521718015/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334365639&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[V]&lt;/a&gt;. If other references arise, I will make these explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to give thanks to AM and VD for innumerable conversations that attempt to break down the language barriers between geometers and a stubborn algebraist such as myself. I would also like to thank CW for the conversations that motivated this side project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Section 1 &amp;#8211; Locally Free Coherent Sheaves of Projective Schemes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Chern classes began for me with the Intersection Theory appendix of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334373945&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[H]&lt;/a&gt;: Let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; be a projective &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{k}&lt;/span&gt;-scheme. For simplicity, assume &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{k} = \overline{\mathbb{k}}&lt;/span&gt;. There is a unique way to associate to each locally free coherent sheaf &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; a formal polynomial &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;c_t(E) = \sum_{i=0} c_i(E)t^i&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;c_i(E) \in A_i(X)&lt;/span&gt; such that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Functoriality.&lt;/b&gt; For &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f: Y \rightarrow X&lt;/span&gt;, for locally free coherent sheaf &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;, then &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;c_t(f^*\mathcal{E}) = f^*c_t(E)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Normality.&lt;/b&gt; For any any line bundle &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{L}(D)&lt;/span&gt;, we have that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;c_t(\mathcal{E}) = 1 + Dt&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additivity.&lt;/b&gt; For any short exact sequence&lt;br /&gt;
\\[0 \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{E}\\,&#39; \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{E} \\longrightarrow\\mathcal{E}\\,&#39;&#39; \\longrightarrow 0,\\]we have &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;c_t(\mathcal{E}) = c_t(\mathcal{E}\,&amp;#8217;)c_t(\mathcal{E}\,&amp;#8221;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement is proven in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numdam.org/item?id=BSMF_1958__86__137_0&quot;&gt;[Gr1]&lt;/a&gt;. Here, Chern classes &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;c_i(\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt; is defined by&lt;br /&gt;
\\[\\sum_{i = 0}^r (-1)^i\\pi^*c_i(\\mathcal{E}).\\xi^{r - i} = 0\\]where &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\xi&lt;/span&gt; is the generator of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A^*(\mathbb{P}\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt; as a free module over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;A^*(X)&lt;/span&gt;. It is unique of all characteristic classes satisfying functoriality, normality, and additivity. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numdam.org/item?id=BSMF_1958__86__137_0&quot;&gt;[Gr1]&lt;/a&gt; offers an explanation, albeit unintuitive, of how the geometric Chern class is the same as its algebraic counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following, we briefly introduce the notions necessary to define and understand Chern classes in the algebraic setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.1 Projectivization of Locally Free Coherent Sheaves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the remainder, let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt; be a locally free coherent sheaf on a scheme &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;. That is, there exist affine open subsets &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\{U_i \subseteq X\\}&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;, for which &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}|_{U_i} = \tilde{M_i}&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;M_i&lt;/span&gt; is a free &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(U_i)&lt;/span&gt; module, and &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\tilde{M_i}&lt;/span&gt; is the sheaf of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{O}_{U_i}&lt;/span&gt;-module associated to &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;M_i&lt;/span&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334373945&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[H]&lt;/a&gt; 2.5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt; be the symmetric algebra on &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt;:\\[S(\\mathcal{E}) = \\bigoplus_{i \\geq 0} S^i(\\mathcal{E}).\\] Locally, it sends an open subset &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{E}(U)) = \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} S^i(\mathcal{E}(U))&lt;/span&gt;. One can check via (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334373945&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[H]&lt;/a&gt; Ex 2.1.22) that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt; is a sheaf on &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;. In particular, locally at least, the module is graded by tensor power (and you may wish to verify that the grading is preserved along transition maps). It is easy to see that for &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U = \mathrm{spec} R&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;, the generators of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\Gamma(U, \mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt; generate the symmetric algebra &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{E}(U))&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{O}(1)&lt;/span&gt; be the hyperplane bundle over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}^n = \mathbf{Proj}\mathbb{k}[x_0,...,x_n]&lt;/span&gt;, then locally over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U_i = D_+(x_i)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{O}(1)&lt;/span&gt; is generated by &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x_i&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R_i = \mathbb{k}[x_0,\dots,x_n]_{x_i}&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{O}(1)(U_i))&lt;/span&gt; is the graded ring &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;R_i[x_it]&lt;/span&gt;. The transition maps of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U_i&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U_j&lt;/span&gt; is obtained from the (degree 0) ring map which sends &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x_it \in R_i[x_it]&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x_jt\cdot x_i/x_j \in R_j[x_jt]&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we construct the projective fibre bundle from the sheaf &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt;, which is a scheme &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt; together with a map &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\pi: \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}) \rightarrow X&lt;/span&gt; such that the fibre over each &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;p \in X&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbf{Proj}\,S(\mathcal{E}_p)&lt;/span&gt;. The construction is exactly that of (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334373945&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[H]&lt;/a&gt;, p 160), applied to &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Construction:&lt;/b&gt; to each affine open subset &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; on which &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt; is trivial associate the projective space &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbf{Proj}\,S(\mathcal{E}(U))&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbf{Proj}\,S(\mathcal{E}(U))&lt;/span&gt; is well-defined since &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;S(\mathcal{E}(U))&lt;/span&gt; is graded (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334373945&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[H]&lt;/a&gt; p 76-77). This gives a family of projective schemes &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\{P_U = \mathbf{Proj} S(\mathcal{E}(U))\,|\,U \subset X\textrm{ is affine open}\}&lt;/span&gt;. The end goal is to use (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334373945&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[H]&lt;/a&gt;, Ex 2.2.12). To do so, we must obtain a subcollection &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\{U \subset X \| U \textrm{ open in }X\}&lt;/span&gt; of the open sets covering &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; such that for every &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U, V \subset X&lt;/span&gt; we have that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;P_{UV} \subset P_U, P_{VU} \subset P_V&lt;/span&gt; and that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;P_{UV} \simeq P_{VU}&lt;/span&gt;. In our case, notice that over &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt; on which &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt; is trivial, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;P_U = \mathbb{P}^{n &amp;#8211; 1} \times U&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; is the rank of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt;. With this in mind, let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;i_U&lt;/span&gt; (resp. &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;i_V&lt;/span&gt;) be the inclusion of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U \cap V&lt;/span&gt; into &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt; (resp. &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;). Then, set &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;P_{UV} = \mathbb{P}^n \times i_U(U \cap V)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;P_{VU} = \mathbb{P}^n \times i_V(U \cap V)&lt;/span&gt;. If we let the subcollection of open subsets of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; be those on which &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt; is trivial, it is easy to see that the conditions of (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441928073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;#038;ie=UTF8&amp;#038;qid=1334373945&amp;#038;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;[H]&lt;/a&gt;, Ex 2.2.12) is satisfied. We obtain from the gluing: a scheme &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})&lt;/span&gt; together with a map &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\pi: \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}) \rightarrow X&lt;/span&gt; such that at the fibre of each point &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; is a projective scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example&lt;/b&gt;. If &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/span&gt; is trivial, then &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}) = \mathbb{P}^{n &amp;#8211; 1} \times X&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; (assuming &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; connected) is the (global) rank of the bundle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}(1))&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}^n?&lt;/span&gt;? On each &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;U_i = D_+(x_i)&lt;/span&gt;, we have trivial line-bundles, hence &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\pi^{-1}(U_i) = \mathbb{P}^0 \times U_i&lt;/span&gt;. One might think that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}(1)) = \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}) = \mathbb{P}^n&lt;/span&gt;. In fact, this is not true: no trivialization exists for &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}(1))&lt;/span&gt;. To see this, it is enough to show that there are no constant nonzero sections of &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}(1))&lt;/span&gt;. To see this, notice that &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Of Mass Effect, Games, and Art</title>
   <link href="http://blog.knightfu.com/2012/03/27/of-mass-effect-games-art.html"/>
   <updated>2012-03-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.knightfu.com/2012/03/27/of-mass-effect-games-art</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The recent outrage over Mass Effect 3&amp;#8242;s ending has sparked quite a &amp;#8220;debate&amp;#8221;. Really, it&amp;#8217;s not a debate, more like fans talking in a cordoned section of the internet while the others &amp;#8212; game critics, journalists, game industry giants, and non-Mass Effect gamers &amp;#8212; take turn criticizing how Bioware has caved to public demands while compromising the artistic integrity of the gaming building process. In this regard, CH was right to call the ending &amp;#8220;polarizing&amp;#8221;; it sparked not a discussion about the ending, but the nature of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle with the question myself: should Bioware have altered the outcome of ME3? On the one hand, the ending was not satisfactory. The lack of closure, blatant plot holes, and the dizzying nonsensical, logic-defying, nihilistic ending that many ME fans have labored over 100hrs for merited the outrage. In fact, as a loose ME fan, I was immensely disappointed. An unspoken (or rather, softly spoken) possibility is that a dev schedule is put on Bioware, who bucked under the pressure, and released the best possible product under the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, an artist, in some sense should uphold the so-called &amp;#8220;artistic integrity&amp;#8221;, which refers to the principle that an artistic creation must not and should not be influenced by anyone other than the artists. If Bioware changed the ending to ME, in many ways, they have failed to adhere to their artistic vision, and have allowed the desire of profit or healthy public image take precedent over that very principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I waver between the two thoughts, I am currently leaning towards the idea that a computer game such as ME should in fact be held to a different principle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many scales, video games are an artistic medium. They sometimes have crafted plots that, when done right, can be the instrument to convey immensely deep ideas. Rich with its own artistic techniques, video games have matured since its first inception as merely as a form of entertainment for killing time. Anyone who has followed ME series from the first game would agree that the series has been an emotionally poignant, highly immersive, thematically rich, and philosophically deep episodes that can easily rival any movie or television series. In fact, more than any of the existing story medium &amp;#8212; through deeply involved player interaction &amp;#8212; the world of ME is populated with an unforgettable cast that is difficult to part with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one, felt like I have formed a deep emotional bond with my squad mates; hell, even with some of the side characters such as Charr and Ereba, Shiala, the scientists at Zhu&amp;#8217;s Hope. What the game creators have done seemed impossible to parallel: not in a novel, a movie, or a TV series; in fact, only in a games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there is little doubt that ME&amp;#8217;s creators are artists in every right. Perhaps it is because that the ME series is so beautifully done that we forget an important part of the modern game creation process: commercial  publication and distribution. This often complicates the genre, because publishers and distributers sometimes make important inputs (for better or worse) on the creative process. Though they don&amp;#8217;t necessarily dictate the artistic direction explicitly, publishers may rush production, curtail development processes that force certain dev cycles to preclude a storyline, or redistribute technological resources that can indirectly influence how a story turn out. Whether or not the leaked letters from dev team are real, the truth is probably not far from what is being described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I interpreted the ending to ME3: it was a product of both artistic visions (that part no one can deny) and the commercial nature of games. Not only did the game feel rushed, but that there were numerous plot points that were difficult to brush aside in the final minutes of the game. It felt like such a different game in the final minutes that many have taken to conspiracy theories (which is an interesting psychological and sociological phenomenon in it of itself): much of the cast was out of character, the supposed sacrifices cheapened by an impossible cause of the conflicts, and the player are left watching the story unfold into a meaningless &amp;#8220;tragedy&amp;#8221; that one can see as an uplifting sacrifice, only to question if those outcomes actually warranted the costly struggles and difficult decisions that seemed to have pervaded throughout the final saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that is what art is. There is a chance that we are seeing the Mark Rothko of story telling, a post-modern piece about the futility of hope, about the meaning of triumph even in a struggle that has no victory, about the fundamental disconnect &amp;#8212; both on a logical level, and on an emotional level &amp;#8212; between a world dominated by laws seeking for order and the organic world that we live in. You can give a lot of creative interpretations to that ending and render it with whatever artistic quality that is ascribed to realities of life (we must have a pretty grim view about the realities of life).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the ending still &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; out of place. It &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; as if the choices and the preparation don&amp;#8217;t matter. It &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; that if the ME world were real, then all those who have perished along the way to combat the threat have died in vain. Where do these feelings originate is not necessarily from a desire to see the so-called &amp;#8220;unicorn, rainbow, and cake&amp;#8221; ending where Shepard retires to a beach, playing with his blue children while shooting beer cans against a burning reaper ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between a worth-while sacrifice, a meaningful or deep sense of loss, and one that is sheer nonsense. Captain John Miller(&lt;i&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/i&gt;), General Kuribayashi (&lt;i&gt;Letters from Iwo Jima&lt;/i&gt;), and Frodo Baggins (&lt;i&gt;LotR&lt;/i&gt;) have all paid the ultimate price, fighting for what they believe in. One might even argue that the death of the entire squad in &lt;i&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/i&gt; is largely meaningless: after all, shouldn&amp;#8217;t victory be measured in numbers? But it had a larger theme to speak of, and that question never felt forcibly thrusted upon the audience; in fact, the point was debated throughout the movie, driving the viewers to ask the same. In this sense, while the theme of sacrifice (however bleak) is present throughout these three stories, it never felt out of place. In fact, the stories are empowered by that theme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of ME3, on the other hand, riddled with death, left us wondering &amp;#8220;why?&amp;#8221; Why must this be? There were many possibilities, many other endings that could have been more poignant that gave meaning and context to the struggle. For you see, one doesn&amp;#8217;t even need to win the war (as in &lt;i&gt;Letters&lt;/i&gt;), but that something more noble than a misguided attempt to correct a nonexistent problem, followed by a half-baked attempt to correct this seemed to be in order. To give your life to the fight so that you can survive, so that you can be free, so that you can make a statement about the nature of these misguided attempts to bring order to the universe. As you see, ME1 and 2, and for the majority of 3 made us believe in those very things; then, it seemed as if those more thematic aspects of the story were surrendered. The emotions of those who have been so invested were left grabbing for something to ground the loss of so many that they have cared about; when there is nothing there, what could have been sadness turned into anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of outrage isn&amp;#8217;t unprecedented. When Doyle supposedly killed Sherlock Holmes in &amp;#8220;The Final Problem&amp;#8221;, all of England rebelled (and that is not an exaggeration). And there, Holmes died a death befitting a hero! Under immense fan pressure, Doyle eventually resurrected Holmes, and the literary world benefitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this outrage stemmed from a graver charge than simply being displeased with how Shepard fared in the final hours of ME3. To put it simply, the fans are accusing that the ending was rushed for commercial reasons. If anything, the commercial forces that be have an obligation to deliver something satisfactory for that reason: a commercial obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, artists who claim license over their work might want to ponder about this: the art world doesn&amp;#8217;t consist of only artists who create works for themselves. Art is inherently a dialogue between artists and their respective audience. It has been more so now than ever before. While an artist should not always cater towards the taste and vision of the audience &amp;#8212; those who do this in fact do compromise their integrity &amp;#8212; it has always been an interplay between the two. It makes sense: art is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; arbitrary. It doesn&amp;#8217;t qualify itself as art simply because elsewhere in the piece something beautiful is made, at least not entirely. This notion of creating art for the sake of creating art doesn&amp;#8217;t stand entirely, as there has always been an audience outside of the artist, and tautologically, there must always be someone else who instilled a piece of work with meaning for that piece to be art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that is the case, why can&amp;#8217;t those who are most qualified to give significance to ME3 comment on, and even demand change from, the existing ending, especially since what is there resembled more a rough draft than the finished touch of an artist. It&amp;#8217;s almost as if after painting the Mona Lisa&amp;#8217;s face, Da Vinci simply finished the rest of the canvas with a weird shade of purple. When pressed by his audience, isn&amp;#8217;t the onus on him to justify his artistic taste as to give others a chance to understand and substantiate? If none could be delivered, would it not have been better if he was given a chance to finish his work, especially since what he created was so vivid and breath-taking that it almost makes you cry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the best development of art is those that grew out of the conversation between the creator and the audience, for an important aspect of art is the refinement of ideas and of techniques to convey, expose, clarify, beautify, or pay homage to themes and ideas. Without audience, what differentiates art from the arbitrary rubbish of an idle mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if art is about that dialogue, would it not have been better if it is not the artists&amp;#8217; soliloquy?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An IMO Problem Solved</title>
   <link href="http://blog.knightfu.com/2012/02/17/an-imo-problem-solved.html"/>
   <updated>2012-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.knightfu.com/2012/02/17/an-imo-problem-solved</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently encountered an IMO question that&amp;#8217;s stated as follows: Given a function &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/span&gt;  such that for any &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x, y \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x + y) \leq yf(x) + f(f(x))&lt;/span&gt;, show that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/span&gt;  for all &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x \leq 0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two solutions, and I will present the one that AM and I came up with: one can easily verify that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x) \leq f(f(x))&lt;/span&gt;. Let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f^2(x) = f(f(x))&lt;/span&gt;. We will proceed by showing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x) \leq f^2(0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x) \leq 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f^2(0) = 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At which point the result should be fairly straight-forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show (1), consider &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(f(x)) = f(f(x) + 0) \leq f(x)f(0) + f^2(0)&lt;/span&gt;. From this, we have that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x &amp;#8211; f(0)) \leq -f(0)f(x) + f^2(x) \leq -f(0)f(x) + f(0)f(x) + f^2(0) = f^2(0)&lt;/span&gt;. As &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;  is arbitrary, (1) follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For (2), let &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;y &gt; 0&lt;/span&gt;, and consider &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x &amp;#8211; y + y) \leq yf(x &amp;#8211; y) + f^2(x + y)&lt;/span&gt;. As &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; is positive, we have that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;yf(x &amp;#8211; y) \leq -y^2f(x) + yf(f(x))&lt;/span&gt;, so &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x) \leq -y^2f(x) + yf^2(x) + f^2(x + y)&lt;/span&gt;. Via (1), we have that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(f(x)) \leq f^2(0)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f^2(x + y) \leq f^2(0)&lt;/span&gt;, which in turn implies that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x) \leq -y^2f(x) + (1 + y)f^2(0)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this implies &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;(1 + y^2)f(x) \leq (1 + y)f^2(0)&lt;/span&gt;, which in turn implies that&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
f(x) \\leq \\frac{1 + y}{1 + y^2}f^2(0).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; is arbitrary, we have that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x) \leq 0&lt;/span&gt;: this proves (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove (3), notice that for any &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(x) = f(x &amp;#8211; 1 + 1) \leq f(x &amp;#8211; 1) + f(f(x &amp;#8211; 1))&lt;/span&gt;, and use (1). That is &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;2f^2(0) \geq f(x)&lt;/span&gt; for any &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; in particular, &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;x = f(0)&lt;/span&gt;. Together with (2), we have &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f^2(0) = 0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f^2(0) \leq f^3(0) = f(0)&lt;/span&gt;, we have that &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;f(0) = 0&lt;/span&gt;; now observe &lt;span class=&quot;render-math&quot;&gt;0 = f(0) = f(x &amp;#8211; x) \leq -xf(x) + f(f(x))&lt;/span&gt;. The main result follows.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>dear avery</title>
   <link href="http://blog.knightfu.com/2011/08/23/dear-avery.html"/>
   <updated>2011-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.knightfu.com/2011/08/23/dear-avery</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I first listened to &amp;#8220;Dear Avery&amp;#8221; on the drive to Grand Manan Island, and it sounded chillingly beautiful; but like many Decemberists songs, the lyrics were all jumbled, perhaps intentionally, by Meloy&amp;#8217;s vocal style. Even though the lyrics were in the car, folded up neatly in a booklet with trees against a yellow sky, I didn&amp;#8217;t read it, or interpret it till now. Now, after scores of listening, till I can practically recall the blurry syllables by memory, I finally flipped through the little booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time, in a conversation, I called Meloy the Poe of folk rock. I was thinking of songs like &amp;#8220;Shankill Butchers&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Eli, the Barrow Boy&amp;#8221;. His songs are not short of morbidity, sometimes even sneaking in the allusion through carefully chosen words that served as his plausible deniability when cornered by avid meaning-seekers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was his creative writing degree that set him apart from many lesser lyricists. Nonetheless, it seems that one cannot write a song nowadays whose meaning is as clear as day. After all, what is the fun in knowing exactly what you are listening to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I don&amp;#8217;t think Decemberists songs are necessarily puzzles: scattered clues embedded in the chorus or the bridge, a single line to highlight the story that was sung with more clarity than the rest. I think art in general shouldn&amp;#8217;t necessarily be a puzzle, though often are. To obscure what is being sung or said, the words are cleaned, refined, and packaged into small transparent boxes of post-modern confusion, forcing us to grope at the moods and the thoughts; the age we live in defines the shape of the art. How ironic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, &amp;#8220;Dear Avery&amp;#8221; is one of those songs that seemed at the cusp of being a story. The song began as a letter would: &amp;#8220;Dear Avery, Think of you only,&amp;#8221; which almost immediately sets the tone of intimacy, as if we are reading a letter sandwiched in a diary, or hidden in a box carefully tucked beneath the bed and the dresser; and thus, song became letter from a parent to son. It teases you about what it could potentially mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, two phrases stand out: &amp;#8220;grab you by the nape of your neck,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;bend back and shake at your frame.&amp;#8221; No doubt it conjured up the imagery of a dog; and some very brave souls out there wrote about just that on songmeanings and youtube, and it was brilliant, and perhaps even plausible given how slippery Meloy can be as a lyricist about the subjects of his songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there were all these references to a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I don&amp;#8217;t think it is about a lost puppy; and if there are some who can be that creative and forward about their thoughts, then I can be a bit brave for my thoughts. Indeed, I think it is a letter &amp;#8212; though not written to be read &amp;#8212; from a parent to a child, but the story is made difficult to understand because, with already the backdrop clear and the chilling emotions that hang above the hand that wrote it, some words were missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give the song my interpretation, I will fill in the words that should have been (the original text of the lyrics in bold):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Avery:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;I think of you only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I read about the invasion, and I saw a picture of your company. &lt;strong&gt;Were you waving then, or were you already dead on the vine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, Avery, to think of you lonely, would I could just grab you by the nape of your neck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When you left for the war, I recall telling you &lt;strong&gt;that there are times life will rattle your bones and will bend your limbs. But you [were] still far and away the boy you&amp;#8217;ve ever been. So you bend back and shake at the frame of the frame you made. But don&amp;#8217;t you shake alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Please, Avery, come home.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the words are from a grieving parent to a child lost in a war, and &amp;#8220;bend back and shake at the frame&amp;#8221; is a very cunning imagery to describe the fatal shots that struck his body; &amp;#8220;but don&amp;#8217;t you shake alone&amp;#8221; to the hope that perhaps in his last moments, he was able to receive some measure of comfort, and perhaps to express that in that moment, the narrator&amp;#8217;s thoughts and heart were with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not wish to disguise just how clumsy this interpretation is at explaining why the chorus was written in the present tense. Perhaps the narrator is lost in the thought, intuitively rejecting Avery&amp;#8217;s death, which may or may not be; doubts conjured by the lines &amp;#8220;were you waving, were you dead on the vine?&amp;#8221; that perhaps a faint hope of his still being alive. Hence, &amp;#8220;please, Avery, come home.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess those would be the thoughts that I would have for my child&amp;#8217;s missing in a war: hope (&amp;#8220;come home&amp;#8221;), remembrance (&amp;#8220;head strong&amp;#8230;cusp of your teens&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;the boy you&amp;#8217;ve ever been&amp;#8221;), denial (&amp;#8220;were you waving&amp;#8221;), and perhaps even guilt (&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; you were my Avery&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;when you needed saving&amp;#8230;I could just grab&amp;#8221;). In such times, the mind seeks comfort from but also finds much dissonance in all these thoughts; most emphatically, boyhood can serve as an aegis to protect the youth from destruction, that perhaps &amp;#8212; for the father, as well as for us &amp;#8212; there is still a possibility that Avery will just come home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the song &amp;#8220;Dear Avery&amp;#8221; echoed &amp;#8220;Yankee Bayonet,&amp;#8221; a duet that told two stories. The duet, also in second person, though, is more straightforward. The civil war soldier&amp;#8217;s wife&amp;#8217;s dialog with his ghost, contrasted with a strangely joyous tune, almost seemed pleasant and warm, as if he were still among the living. Perhaps it is with the same sentiment that &amp;#8220;Dear Avery&amp;#8221; was written: parting words to a fallen child that perhaps one day he will return home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall listening to &amp;#8220;the Bus Mall&amp;#8221; for almost a year before realizing that it was in fact about two male prostitutes in Portland. So much my prejudice that ought to be overcome. Yet, perhaps that is as songs ought to be: they were written with some meaning in mind, but how it does mean is left to the moulding by the listener. It perhaps is a bit of subjectivism; I do not deny that there is something that an artist intends to convey. I am merely proposing that such intentions sometimes do not matter, and how stimulating a thought that part of a work of art is what the audience takes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if what you&amp;#8217;ve taken away from it is a runaway border collie, what a lovely song it is, &amp;#8220;Dear Avery.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Context Parsing</title>
   <link href="http://blog.knightfu.com/2011/07/13/context-parsing.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Parsing loosely refers to an association of l from (Free(L), D) to Tree(Free(L\D)) where for each text M in (Free(L), D), the nodes of l(M) are subwords of M. Here, L is the allowed characters of a language, and D is the subset of L consists of the delimiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In language parsing, you also require that a child of a node is a subword of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context parsing (I&amp;#8217;m thinking about patterns and templates) needs to be fleshed out. I don&amp;#8217;t have time to do that now, but here&amp;#8217;s a note to self so that I can think about this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>This Hallowed Ground</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Without a shadow of a doubt&lt;br /&gt;
We gathered around and pierced the clouds:&lt;br /&gt;
Three gray spots against a sea of blue&lt;br /&gt;
To fill the hills with morbid black&lt;br /&gt;
To close their eyes, and lay them down&lt;br /&gt;
On this summer day, in this quiet town&lt;br /&gt;
And swiftly they obeyed, and all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We turned easily around&lt;br /&gt;
Against the murmuring sun, and the deafening sound&lt;br /&gt;
But not averting our eyes from the light&lt;br /&gt;
Cheering silently at the spectacle&lt;br /&gt;
And then all was quiet, and we closed our eyes&lt;br /&gt;
Above the clouds, where all was white,&lt;br /&gt;
Returning home, or was it retreating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at night when the light was dead&lt;br /&gt;
Spots of black flames raged instead.&lt;br /&gt;
A finger pointing to the stars,&lt;br /&gt;
Whispering crackles, sparks, and sizzles &amp;#8211;&lt;br /&gt;
It once was flesh but now is stone &amp;#8211;&lt;br /&gt;
Remembering of its skin and bones&lt;br /&gt;
Is the only statue in the house of gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never seen these hills,&lt;br /&gt;
Felt the push, sensed the chills&lt;br /&gt;
Or covered by these sheets of flame&lt;br /&gt;
That grew in number, even as it rained.&lt;br /&gt;
I only decided that all was right&lt;br /&gt;
To come to you at the dead of night&lt;br /&gt;
To teach you to stop killing us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the last to touch the sphere&lt;br /&gt;
As I armed the triggers in the rear&lt;br /&gt;
I closed my eyes to the sounds of wailing&lt;br /&gt;
Of a girl dying slowly, burning&lt;br /&gt;
Of a boy of seven hardening into stone&lt;br /&gt;
Crawling, struggling, dying all alone&lt;br /&gt;
And to think that I am sure any more &amp;#8212; I am not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single shadow for a single soul&lt;br /&gt;
Now a candle floating down a river aglow&lt;br /&gt;
With shaded flames on wooden boats&lt;br /&gt;
In the quiet town where once they were&lt;br /&gt;
Before we came on the August day&lt;br /&gt;
In the steel encasement of the Enola Gay&lt;br /&gt;
And lay them all to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Speculation: What Technology will soon be</title>
   <link href="http://blog.knightfu.com/2010/08/09/speculation-what-technology-will-soon-be.html"/>
   <updated>2010-08-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.knightfu.com/2010/08/09/speculation-what-technology-will-soon-be</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;A &lt;a title=&quot;DI&quot; href=&quot;http://noob-engineer.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;very wise girl&lt;/a&gt; once said to me: &amp;#8220;cellphones are the new laptops.&amp;#8221; I think it is particularly wise, not only because it encapsulates what is going on in the technology market right now, but that it foretells what will be the next point in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Some of you may be familiar with the new TED talk given by &lt;a title=&quot;Pattie Maes - MIT Media Lab&quot; href=&quot;http://web.media.mit.edu/~pattie/&quot;&gt;Pattie Maes&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a title=&quot;Sixth Sense&quot; href=&quot;http://ambient.media.mit.edu/people/pranav/current/sixthsense.html&quot;&gt;SixthSense&lt;/a&gt;, and it only highlights some of the possibilities of a seamless integration of the web knowledge base into everyday life. Coming from someone who has yet to own a phone that can browse the web, what I am saying may not hold much weight, but a 15 minute research on the web will reveal an abundant of applications written for various &amp;#8220;internet phones&amp;#8221; such as the iPhone or the Android, and it is only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;However, I am going to venture further, and say that we are no longer dealing with phones, but portable data and applications, with a focus on interactivity. (It is only coincidental that phones became the first instance of portabilized technology. I suspect that the major role of phone companies in the future is to provide wifi access to portable devices, but I digress.) The major features of these applications in the present are that they are 1) standalone, 2) integrable with existing internet technologies, 3) lightweight, 4) interactive with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Why would someone turn on their cellphone to use its widgets? Well, these widgets open quickly, allow us to access information that would not otherwise be possible (e.g. without a laptop connected to the web), and do not require a great effort in inputting the information that we are trying to search. Of course, applications can only grow in complexity, but two components will remain indefinitely: integrated with the web, and intuitively operable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;That is precisely what defines the success of technologies such as SixthSense, and what will continue to hold the stage for portable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;And it has implications for the future of developers. For one, we need to focus on securely integrating web information with portable devices. Well, that is more or less done with existing server technologies and HTML/Javascript (or ECMAScript, if you will)/AJAX/flash. Yet, creative methods for displaying information is still lacking. The reason that the webpages work so well is because we usually have a 17&amp;#8243;x12&amp;#8243; (or bigger) viewing space to work with. How can we convey just as much information (if not more) in a handheld, or where the viewing space is restricted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Another much more important dimension is interactivity. Recognizing user inputs is going to be a giant cornerstone. We need to develop ways of recognizing gestures, speeding up computer visions (as much of the inputs will be visual), refining audio inputs, quickly reacting to gyroscopic motions and changes in location. User interfaces must make room for all these forms of intuitive input modes, and it is of great interest to me to see the kind of API that is created that allows developers to add these interactive modes to their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;There are also implications for data management and security as well, but lest I should venture into really unfamiliar grounds, I refrain from commenting further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;One of the things that SixthSense showed me is how much a seamless integration of the web with our surrounding can improve our lives. It is not far from the true sense of the phrase &amp;#8220;sixth sense&amp;#8221; where we can interact with our surroundings through an augmented collective knowledge base of the human race. It is yet another evolution in technology, and one that we cannot avoid, but must do our best to do it well.&lt;/p&gt;

<p style="text-align: left;">A <a title="DI" href="http://noob-engineer.blogspot.com/">very wise girl</a> once said to me: &#8220;cellphones are the new laptops.&#8221; I think it is particularly wise, not only because it encapsulates what is going on in the technology market right now, but that it foretells what will be the next point in technology.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Some of you may be familiar with the new TED talk given by <a title="Pattie Maes - MIT Media Lab" href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~pattie/">Pattie Maes</a> about <a title="Sixth Sense" href="http://ambient.media.mit.edu/people/pranav/current/sixthsense.html">SixthSense</a>, and it only highlights some of the possibilities of a seamless integration of the web knowledge base into everyday life. Coming from someone who has yet to own a phone that can browse the web, what I am saying may not hold much weight, but a 15 minute research on the web will reveal an abundant of applications written for various &#8220;internet phones&#8221; such as the iPhone or the Android, and it is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, I am going to venture further, and say that we are no longer dealing with phones, but portable data and applications, with a focus on interactivity. (It is only coincidental that phones became the first instance of portabilized technology. I suspect that the major role of phone companies in the future is to provide wifi access to portable devices, but I digress.) The major features of these applications in the present are that they are 1) standalone, 2) integrable with existing internet technologies, 3) lightweight, 4) interactive with the environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why would someone turn on their cellphone to use its widgets? Well, these widgets open quickly, allow us to access information that would not otherwise be possible (e.g. without a laptop connected to the web), and do not require a great effort in inputting the information that we are trying to search. Of course, applications can only grow in complexity, but two components will remain indefinitely: integrated with the web, and intuitively operable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That is precisely what defines the success of technologies such as SixthSense, and what will continue to hold the stage for portable technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And it has implications for the future of developers. For one, we need to focus on securely integrating web information with portable devices. Well, that is more or less done with existing server technologies and HTML/Javascript (or ECMAScript, if you will)/AJAX/flash. Yet, creative methods for displaying information is still lacking. The reason that the webpages work so well is because we usually have a 17&#8243;x12&#8243; (or bigger) viewing space to work with. How can we convey just as much information (if not more) in a handheld, or where the viewing space is restricted?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another much more important dimension is interactivity. Recognizing user inputs is going to be a giant cornerstone. We need to develop ways of recognizing gestures, speeding up computer visions (as much of the inputs will be visual), refining audio inputs, quickly reacting to gyroscopic motions and changes in location. User interfaces must make room for all these forms of intuitive input modes, and it is of great interest to me to see the kind of API that is created that allows developers to add these interactive modes to their applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are also implications for data management and security as well, but lest I should venture into really unfamiliar grounds, I refrain from commenting further.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the things that SixthSense showed me is how much a seamless integration of the web with our surrounding can improve our lives. It is not far from the true sense of the phrase &#8220;sixth sense&#8221; where we can interact with our surroundings through an augmented collective knowledge base of the human race. It is yet another evolution in technology, and one that we cannot avoid, but must do our best to do it well.</p>

title: Context Parsing
---

<p>Parsing loosely refers to an association of l from (Free(L), D) to Tree(Free(L\D)) where for each text M in (Free(L), D), the nodes of l(M) are subwords of M. Here, L is the allowed characters of a language, and D is the subset of L consists of the delimiters.</p>

<p>In language parsing, you also require that a child of a node is a subword of the parent.</p>
<p>Context parsing (I&#8217;m thinking about patterns and templates) needs to be fleshed out. I don&#8217;t have time to do that now, but here&#8217;s a note to self so that I can think about this in the future.</p>

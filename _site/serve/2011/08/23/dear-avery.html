  <p>I first listened to &#8220;Dear Avery&#8221; on the drive to Grand Manan Island, and it sounded chillingly beautiful; but like many Decemberists songs, the lyrics were all jumbled, perhaps intentionally, by Meloy&#8217;s vocal style. Even though the lyrics were in the car, folded up neatly in a booklet with trees against a yellow sky, I didn&#8217;t read it, or interpret it till now. Now, after scores of listening, till I can practically recall the blurry syllables by memory, I finally flipped through the little booklet.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At one time, in a conversation, I called Meloy the Poe of folk rock. I was thinking of songs like &#8220;Shankill Butchers&#8221; or &#8220;Eli, the Barrow Boy&#8221;. His songs are not short of morbidity, sometimes even sneaking in the allusion through carefully chosen words that served as his plausible deniability when cornered by avid meaning-seekers. </p>
<p>Perhaps it was his creative writing degree that set him apart from many lesser lyricists. Nonetheless, it seems that one cannot write a song nowadays whose meaning is as clear as day. After all, what is the fun in knowing exactly what you are listening to?</p>
<p>Yet, I don&#8217;t think Decemberists songs are necessarily puzzles: scattered clues embedded in the chorus or the bridge, a single line to highlight the story that was sung with more clarity than the rest. I think art in general shouldn&#8217;t necessarily be a puzzle, though often are. To obscure what is being sung or said, the words are cleaned, refined, and packaged into small transparent boxes of post-modern confusion, forcing us to grope at the moods and the thoughts; the age we live in defines the shape of the art. How ironic.</p>
<p>Even so, &#8220;Dear Avery&#8221; is one of those songs that seemed at the cusp of being a story. The song began as a letter would: &#8220;Dear Avery, Think of you only,&#8221; which almost immediately sets the tone of intimacy, as if we are reading a letter sandwiched in a diary, or hidden in a box carefully tucked beneath the bed and the dresser; and thus, song became letter from a parent to son. It teases you about what it could potentially mean.</p>
<p>On the one hand, two phrases stand out: &#8220;grab you by the nape of your neck,&#8221; &#8220;bend back and shake at your frame.&#8221; No doubt it conjured up the imagery of a dog; and some very brave souls out there wrote about just that on songmeanings and youtube, and it was brilliant, and perhaps even plausible given how slippery Meloy can be as a lyricist about the subjects of his songs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were all these references to a child.</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t think it is about a lost puppy; and if there are some who can be that creative and forward about their thoughts, then I can be a bit brave for my thoughts. Indeed, I think it is a letter &#8212; though not written to be read &#8212; from a parent to a child, but the story is made difficult to understand because, with already the backdrop clear and the chilling emotions that hang above the hand that wrote it, some words were missing.</p>
<p>To give the song my interpretation, I will fill in the words that should have been (the original text of the lyrics in bold):</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Dear Avery:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>I think of you only.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I read about the invasion, and I saw a picture of your company. <strong>Were you waving then, or were you already dead on the vine?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Oh, Avery, to think of you lonely, would I could just grab you by the nape of your neck.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When you left for the war, I recall telling you <strong>that there are times life will rattle your bones and will bend your limbs. But you [were] still far and away the boy you&#8217;ve ever been. So you bend back and shake at the frame of the frame you made. But don&#8217;t you shake alone.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Please, Avery, come home.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>For me, the words are from a grieving parent to a child lost in a war, and &#8220;bend back and shake at the frame&#8221; is a very cunning imagery to describe the fatal shots that struck his body; &#8220;but don&#8217;t you shake alone&#8221; to the hope that perhaps in his last moments, he was able to receive some measure of comfort, and perhaps to express that in that moment, the narrator&#8217;s thoughts and heart were with him. </p>
<p>I do not wish to disguise just how clumsy this interpretation is at explaining why the chorus was written in the present tense. Perhaps the narrator is lost in the thought, intuitively rejecting Avery&#8217;s death, which may or may not be; doubts conjured by the lines &#8220;were you waving, were you dead on the vine?&#8221; that perhaps a faint hope of his still being alive. Hence, &#8220;please, Avery, come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess those would be the thoughts that I would have for my child&#8217;s missing in a war: hope (&#8220;come home&#8221;), remembrance (&#8220;head strong&#8230;cusp of your teens&#8221;, &#8220;the boy you&#8217;ve ever been&#8221;), denial (&#8220;were you waving&#8221;), and perhaps even guilt (&#8220;<em>but</em> you were my Avery&#8221;, &#8220;when you needed saving&#8230;I could just grab&#8221;). In such times, the mind seeks comfort from but also finds much dissonance in all these thoughts; most emphatically, boyhood can serve as an aegis to protect the youth from destruction, that perhaps &#8212; for the father, as well as for us &#8212; there is still a possibility that Avery will just come home.</p>
<p>In many ways, the song &#8220;Dear Avery&#8221; echoed &#8220;Yankee Bayonet,&#8221; a duet that told two stories. The duet, also in second person, though, is more straightforward. The civil war soldier&#8217;s wife&#8217;s dialog with his ghost, contrasted with a strangely joyous tune, almost seemed pleasant and warm, as if he were still among the living. Perhaps it is with the same sentiment that &#8220;Dear Avery&#8221; was written: parting words to a fallen child that perhaps one day he will return home.</p>
<p>I recall listening to &#8220;the Bus Mall&#8221; for almost a year before realizing that it was in fact about two male prostitutes in Portland. So much my prejudice that ought to be overcome. Yet, perhaps that is as songs ought to be: they were written with some meaning in mind, but how it does mean is left to the moulding by the listener. It perhaps is a bit of subjectivism; I do not deny that there is something that an artist intends to convey. I am merely proposing that such intentions sometimes do not matter, and how stimulating a thought that part of a work of art is what the audience takes away.</p>
<p>And even if what you&#8217;ve taken away from it is a runaway border collie, what a lovely song it is, &#8220;Dear Avery.&#8221;</p>

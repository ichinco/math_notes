\chapter{Hensel Local Rings}

If the reader is sufficiently motivated to learn about 
completions, then the following example taken from \cite{Eisenbud}
Chapter 7 can be safely skipped.

\section{Completions, Filtrations, and Artin-Rees.}

We begin the discussion with a topological excursion, as to lay 
the ground work for discussions regarding ``adic'' completion in 
this section. This topic is developed from the view point of a 
topological group. In this case, the group is a commutative ring 
$R$ with a topology given by a system of ideals; certainly, the 
ideas are more general. We do not treat the topic in full 
generality, though the ideas will come up again in our discussion 
of profinite groups in Appendix \ref{appendix:profinite}. The
results here are taken from \cite{AM}, \cite{MatsCA} and 
\cite{Eisenbud} as quasi-fascimile. Readers who are familiar with
the ``adic'' completion and related results can safely skip this
section.

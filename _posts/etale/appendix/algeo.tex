\chapter{Appendix --- Baby AlGeo}

There is so much to algebraic geometry. A professor once said that 
it took him two years to scratch the surface of the subject. For 
some others, it may be more. At the risk of writing another book
for algebraic geometry, the author wishes to compile some key 
results, formerly organized as exercises in \cite{Hart}, 
\cite{Liu} or \cite{Mum}, but are crucial for the reader's 
understanding of classical constructions that pervade the 
literature.

Therefore, to make the most out of these notes, a reader should
have done roughly 90\% of all the exercises in Hartshorne at least 
a year ago. The reaction to most of the results in this section 
should be --- the author hopes --- ``ah! I remember now''. It is 
not encouraged to use these notes to get out of doing any form of 
exercises for grad level course in this subject, as it is most
underhanded to impress other mathematicians with results that one 
did not obtain, from a book that one did not pay for (or reserved 
from the library).

The other requirement (as is understood almost implicitly) is that
the reader is completely familiar with the contents of \cite{AM},
or has a passing familiarity with \cite{MatsCA}.

title: This Hallowed Ground
---

<p>Without a shadow of a doubt<br />
We gathered around and pierced the clouds:<br />
Three gray spots against a sea of blue<br />
To fill the hills with morbid black<br />
To close their eyes, and lay them down<br />
On this summer day, in this quiet town<br />
And swiftly they obeyed, and all at once.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We turned easily around<br />
Against the murmuring sun, and the deafening sound<br />
But not averting our eyes from the light<br />
Cheering silently at the spectacle<br />
And then all was quiet, and we closed our eyes<br />
Above the clouds, where all was white,<br />
Returning home, or was it retreating.</p>
<p>And at night when the light was dead<br />
Spots of black flames raged instead.<br />
A finger pointing to the stars,<br />
Whispering crackles, sparks, and sizzles &#8211;<br />
It once was flesh but now is stone &#8211;<br />
Remembering of its skin and bones<br />
Is the only statue in the house of gods.</p>
<p>I have never seen these hills,<br />
Felt the push, sensed the chills<br />
Or covered by these sheets of flame<br />
That grew in number, even as it rained.<br />
I only decided that all was right<br />
To come to you at the dead of night<br />
To teach you to stop killing us.</p>
<p>I am the last to touch the sphere<br />
As I armed the triggers in the rear<br />
I closed my eyes to the sounds of wailing<br />
Of a girl dying slowly, burning<br />
Of a boy of seven hardening into stone<br />
Crawling, struggling, dying all alone<br />
And to think that I am sure any more &#8212; I am not.</p>
<p>A single shadow for a single soul<br />
Now a candle floating down a river aglow<br />
With shaded flames on wooden boats<br />
In the quiet town where once they were<br />
Before we came on the August day<br />
In the steel encasement of the Enola Gay<br />
And lay them all to sleep.</p>
